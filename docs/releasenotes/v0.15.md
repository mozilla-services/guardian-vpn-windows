# Firefox Private Network VPN for Windows v0.15 Release Notes

March 18, 2020

## New

### Improved handling of captive portal networks.

We will better handle networks which utilize captive portal techniques for access control, such as cafes and airports. We'll also remind you when you can connect back after interacting.

### Introduced network activity graph panel.

After connecting, an activity graph is now available, indicating the VPN network utilization.

### IPv6 can now be disabled/enabled.

Should you elect not to use IPv6 when connected, you can do so by unchecking the appropriate checkbox.

### Accessibility improvements

We've done our best to improve compatibility with screen readers.

## Fixed

### Stability fixes in multi-user Windows environments.

If you have multiple users on your Windows PC, all of you can now control the VPN connection.

### Translation improvements

Areas of the application that were previously untranslated have now been translated.

## Changed

### Removed need for UAC prompts at every launch.

Previous to this, a popup asking you for administrative privileges was appearing after initial connects when you launch Firefox Private Network VPN.

### Servers are now grouped into cities.

Instead of picking a separate server each time, servers are now grouped into cities with the optimal server being picked automatically.
